// see if you can get Mario up on the screen!
// 2022-02-11 Assignment 1
// write up the MaterialComponent to get pants on Mario
// load png from harddrive, send it down to the GPU
// steal code from Texture.cpp on Scott's website, follow pattern/outline from this semester
// understand it. Was called Textures in OpenGL class but Unity calls it a Material
// Stick it into the Material Component
// make tectureID a GLUint member variable
// use the textureVert and textureFrag shaders instead
// finish the lightActor. Build material
// bind the material, before the draw call
// pass the light position to the GPU
