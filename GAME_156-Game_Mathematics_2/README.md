Introductory course to Linear Alegbra, focusing on vector, matirix 
manipulation. Objective for this course was to represent 3D objects such
as rays and planes using 3D vectors by scale, rototae and translate 3D points using matrices, as well as represent orientiation through the use of 
quaternions.
