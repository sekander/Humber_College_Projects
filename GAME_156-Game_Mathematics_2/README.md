<h1>Linear Algebra</h1>

Introductory course to Linear Algebra, focusing on vector and matrix manipulation. The objective for this course was to represent 3D objects such as rays and planes using 3D vectors and transform matrices to scale, rotate, translate, and define orientation through quaternions.
