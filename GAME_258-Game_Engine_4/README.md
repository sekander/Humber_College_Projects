<h1>Game Engines 4 - Component Framework</h1>

Further expanding 3D graphics through the use of OpenGL focusing on reueusable code and smart pointers to easily manage and organize data used by the application. Learned how to use external files to load assets through the use of tinyXML, and incoprated Enity Component System(ECS) design model.



<h2>Scene 0</h2>
This assignment focused on loading in 3D models throguh an XML parser, such that each model can be easily position and orientation can be modiefied through an XML document without recompiling the code.
