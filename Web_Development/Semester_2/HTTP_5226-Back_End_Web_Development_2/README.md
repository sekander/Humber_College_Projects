# Web Development Project

## Course Code: HTTP 5225  
**Academic Year**: 2025-2026

## Course Overview
In this project-based course, I’ll connect back-end technologies with front-end technologies to create a content management system.

## Course Description
This project-based course focuses on integrating back-end technologies with front-end technologies to develop a content management system (CMS). I’ll learn how to bring together all aspects of web development, from database management to user interface, using a practical, hands-on approach.

## Course Rationale
This course is designed to provide me with opportunities to practice and enhance new skills through project-based learning. By simulating real-world activities of a web developer, I will build on the programming languages, database development, and toolkits learned in the first semester. The course focuses on popular open-source server-side technologies to support the creation of dynamic, web-based applications.

## Program Outcomes Emphasized in This Course
As part of the **Web Development (11491)** program, this course will help me:
- **Determine and document requirements** for web computing projects based on stakeholder needs.
- **Design, model, implement, and optimize accessible web solutions** that meet client requirements and align with best practices and standards.
- **Design, model, implement, optimize, and maintain databases** to support data-driven solutions for web applications.
- **Apply project management concepts** to ensure effective teamwork and project execution.
- **Test, troubleshoot, and debug web applications** to ensure quality assurance and meet requirements.
- **Communicate and collaborate** effectively with team members and stakeholders.

## How I’ll Learn
This course uses a combination of **Action Learning**, **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**, **Project-Based Learning**, **Group/Team Work**, and **Lectures**. These approaches will provide me with the opportunity to work on real projects, collaborate with others, and apply what I’ve learned in practical scenarios.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, I will be able to:
1. **Develop web projects** using the PHP programming language.
2. **Create database-driven websites** with public and administrator CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using MySQL as the back-end database.
3. **Work as part of a development team** to develop and deploy web applications.

This course will equip me with the skills to develop full-stack web applications and prepare me for the collaborative nature of professional web development.
