# Full-Stack Web Development

## Course Code: HTTP 5222  
**Academic Year**: 2025-2026

## Course Overview
This course builds upon the JavaScript skills and techniques covered in the first term, employing a JavaScript framework to create server-side JavaScript web applications. Accessing alternate data sources (including APIs) completes this course, leading to a full-stack JavaScript application deployed to the internet.

## Course Description
In this course, I’ll continue to develop my web development skills, focusing on JavaScript frameworks and libraries to create robust, server-side JavaScript web applications. I’ll also learn how to integrate data from external sources, such as APIs, which will culminate in the development and deployment of a full-stack JavaScript application.

## Course Rationale
Building on the skills learned in the first semester, this course takes a deeper dive into JavaScript, including frameworks like Node.js, as well as debugging, security, and usability techniques. This provides a solid foundation for developing complex, interactive, and secure web applications.

## Program Outcomes Emphasized in This Course
As part of the **Web Development (11491)** program, this course will help me:
- **Determine and document requirements** for web projects based on stakeholder needs.
- **Design, model, implement, optimize, and maintain databases** to support data-driven solutions for web applications.
- **Test, troubleshoot, and debug** web applications to ensure quality assurance objectives are met.
- **Adhere to ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements** in the development and management of web applications.

## How I’ll Learn
This course employs a mix of **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**, **Project-Based Learning**, **Lectures**, and **Cooperative Learning**. These methods will help me apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios, with opportunities for collaboration and feedback.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, I will be able to:
1. **Develop a web application** using Node.js.
2. **Integrate popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks** into my web application.
3. **Utilize efficient debugging methodologies** to test and fix bugs in web applications.
4. **Apply modern usability practices** to enhance the user experience in my web applications.
5. **Evaluate the security** of my web applications.
6. **Integrate API content** into my application using JavaScript, XML, and JSON.

This course equips me with the skills to build dynamic, interactive, and secure full-stack JavaScript applications ready for deployment to the internet.
