# Repository Name

This repository contains [**Back-End-Web-Development-1---HTTP-5125**](https://example.com)

In this course, I learned server-side web development using C#. I explored how to create data-driven websites, hands-on experiences in pulling data from a variety of external sources. My skills in building robust web applications with ASP.NET have been further developed, hence my ability to create dynamic and interactive websites.




## **Why This Course Matters**  
C# is a strictly-typed programming language that’s essential for working with the ASP.NET framework. Mastering C# not only prepares me for developing in ASP.NET but also lays the groundwork for using other strictly-typed coding languages and frameworks.

## **What I’ll Be Able to Do**  
By the end of this course, I’ll have the skills to:  
1. Use C# to apply core programming principles.  
2. Design data source architectures that work seamlessly with web applications.  
3. Build APIs that can be used as data sources for dynamic web projects.
