# Wellness Tracker with CSS Animations

## Concept Overview:

The **Wellness Tracker** app is designed to track and improve users' daily wellness habits, such as exercise, coffee consumption, cigarette smoking, and sleep patterns. The app assigns a score to each user based on these behaviors, which is displayed in a calendar layout. Users will be able to input their results for the current day only; past and future days cannot be edited. This setup encourages real-time tracking and prevents users from manipulating past or future data, ensuring a more accurate reflection of their habits.

## Calendar Layout:

The app's primary interface will feature a **calendar layout** where each day is displayed as a separate "cell." Within each day’s cell, the score for that day will be shown as a grade (e.g., A, B, C), with the background color changing to reflect the performance of the user.

### Example Color-Coding:

- **Green (A)**: Indicates good habits (e.g., exercised, avoided smoking).
- **Yellow (B)**: Indicates moderate habits (e.g., exercised but consumed too much caffeine).
- **Red (C)**: Indicates poor habits (e.g., lack of exercise, high caffeine consumption).

Users can view the score for any day in the calendar, but they cannot edit past days. This ensures that only the current day's habits can be input, reinforcing the idea of real-time tracking.

## Animations and User Interaction:

### Calendar Color Transitions:

- **Animation**: The background color of each calendar day will smoothly transition based on the user's performance for that day. For example, if a user enters a higher score (A), the day's color will animate from a dull shade to vibrant green. If the score is lower, the color will transition from a neutral color to red.
- **CSS Animations**: These color shifts will use keyframe animations to smoothly change between different colors, making the app feel more interactive and dynamic.

### Hover Effects:

- **Animation**: When a user hovers over any calendar day, the score will animate (e.g., slightly enlarge or change opacity). This provides immediate visual feedback, making the UI feel more engaging and responsive.

### Pop-up Details:

- **Animation**: Clicking on a calendar day will trigger an animated pop-up, showing more details about the user’s habits for that day. This pop-up will appear with a smooth fade-in effect, and it could include a bounce animation to draw attention to the displayed data.

### Progress Bar & Mood Indicators:

- **Animation**: Alongside the calendar, the app may have a visual progress bar or circular indicator that animates from empty to full based on the day’s score. This motivates users to improve their habits as they aim to "fill" the bar.

### Celebratory Animations:

For exceptionally good performance (e.g., an A+ day), the app could trigger celebratory effects like falling confetti or a glowing animation around the day’s score. This reinforces positive behavior and adds a fun, gamified element to the experience.

## Layout Structure:

The page will be structured as follows:

- **Header**: Displays the app title “Wellness Tracker” and a motivational tagline.
- **Calendar Grid (Monthly View)**: The default layout will feature a 7-day per row calendar, displaying the entire month. Each day will be clickable, showing a grade and color indicating the user's wellness score.
- **Pop-up (for input)**: When a user clicks on a calendar day, a pop-up will appear with input fields for logging exercise, coffee intake, cigarettes smoked, and sleep quality. After the user submits their data, the calendar will update with the new score and color.
- **Progress Bar / Mood Indicator (optional)**: A visual indicator of the user's overall wellness progress could be placed below or alongside the calendar, offering additional motivation.

## Conclusion:

The **Wellness Tracker** app will provide an interactive and engaging way for users to monitor and improve their wellness habits. By limiting input to the current day and displaying scores in a calendar format with dynamic CSS animations, the app will create an enjoyable user experience. The use of animations (color transitions, hover effects, progress indicators, and celebratory animations) will make the app feel lively and motivating, encouraging users to track their progress regularly.
