# **Workshops in Web Development 1**  

## **What This Course is About**  
This course is all about helping us get the extra support we need for topics covered in our other classes. At the start, we’ll do a **self-assessment** to figure out where we might be struggling, and then work with the teaching team to create a plan to improve. There are **mentors**, **tutors**, and **workshops** available to help us stay on track and tackle challenges as they come up.

## **Why This Course Matters to Me**  
Let’s face it—building complex, database-driven websites isn’t easy. And since the web development industry is always changing, it’s important to learn how to keep improving even after graduation. This course helps us:  
- **Understand our own learning process**: It’s about figuring out what works for us and what doesn’t.  
- **Build the right mindset for Web Development**: Knowing how to approach challenges and create solutions.  
- **Work better in teams**: We meet with our classmates and faculty every week to talk about what’s working and where we need help.

2. Share my concerns about my learning with my classmates and instructors.  
3. Come up with and evaluate solutions to the challenges I’m facing in the program.
