<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

Students examine common artificial intelligence techniques to support control of behaviours and path finding in gameplay. Learners identify uses of path finding, steering behaviours, triggers/sensors, states, and machine learning in existing games. Students build an executable program that demonstrates steering behaviours, flocking, logic based decisions, and finite statemachines.
