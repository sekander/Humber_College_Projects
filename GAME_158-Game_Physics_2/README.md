Game Physics 2

Built a custom 2D phssics engine simulating Netwon's Laws and Netwon's equations of motion. Physics engine is capable of rotational motion calculating torque and detecting collisions between 2D polyons.

Motion
	|-> Applying Netwons equations of motion and simulating in 2D objects 

Collisions
	|-> Detecting collisions between Axis-Aligned bounding box

Polygon_Test
	|-> Testing collisions between spheres, lines and calculate elastisity between polygons and responce. 

Buyouncy
	|-> Simulating buyouncy with 2D polygons
