# Repository Name

This repository contains [**Back-End-Web-Development-1---HTTP-5125**](https://example.com)

In this course, I learned server-side web development using C#. I explored how to create data-driven websites, hands-on experiences in pulling data from a variety of external sources. My skills in building robust web applications with ASP.NET have been further developed, hence my ability to create dynamic and interactive websites.
