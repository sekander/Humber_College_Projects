<h1>Game Engines 5 - Vulkan</h1>
Introductory course to learning Vulkan, acoomplish loading 3D models into the scene, tranform each model using matrix transformations, setup descriptor sets, dynamic descriptor sets, push constants create multiple pipelines and compile shader code in SPIR-V format.  


<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
Created a 3 light system using phong shader model, and was able to modify the lights through the use of UBO.

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
Task for this assignment was to change how models are loaded using push constants. Change the framework allowing the model matrix and the transpose inverse of the model matrix loaded throguh a push constant.

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
Create a two different objects on the screen in the GPU and draw them. This means storing the data in separate vertex and index buffers.
Just create multiple pipelines, multiple objects and have the data downloaded to to the GPU. Store the descriptors as well
Extra: Create multiple textures on to the GPU.
Extra: Go ahead and draw multiple (more than two) objects
