<h1>Game Physics 3</h1>
Students explore the development of a simple 3D physics engine that could be used in their capstone project. Students define the mass distribution of a 3D rigid body. Learners numerically integrate the equations of motion and the orientation quaternion to predict positions for the next frame of their game. Students examine techniques to detect collisions between simple 3D objects.
